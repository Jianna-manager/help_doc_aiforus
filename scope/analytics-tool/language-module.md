# Language Module

A **word cloud** is a visual representation of text data where the **importance or frequency** of each word is shown using **font size, color, or weight**. Words that appear more frequently in the data are displayed **larger or more prominently**, while less frequent words appear smaller.

In our tool, we use frequency to measure the word importance. Larger words have more frequencies. It requires only 2 steps:

1. Enter the text that you want to generate word cloud for.
2. Click "Submit".
