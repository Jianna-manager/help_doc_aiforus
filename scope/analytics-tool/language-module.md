# Language Module

A **word cloud** is a visual representation of text data, where the importance or frequency of each word is indicated by its font size, color, or weight. Words that appear more frequently are displayed larger and more prominently, while less frequent words appear smaller.

In our tool, word importance is measured by frequencyâ€”**the larger the word, the more often it appears**.

Creating a word cloud takes just two simple steps:

1. Enter the text you want to visualize.
2. Click "Submit".
