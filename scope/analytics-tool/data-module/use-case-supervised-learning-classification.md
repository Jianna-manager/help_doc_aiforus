# Use Case: Supervised Learning Classification

## Models

Under supervised learning classification, we have several different models:

*   KNeighbors

    A model that classifies a data point based on how its **nearest neighbors** are labeled. It looks at the 'K' closest points in the training data and predicts the most common label among them.

    > **Best for:** Simple problems with clearly clustered classes.\
    > **Key concept:** “Birds of a feather flock together.”
*   LinearSVC (Linear Support Vector Classifier)

    A fast and efficient classifier that finds a **straight line (or hyperplane)** to separate classes in the data. It is a linear version of the more general Support Vector Machine (SVM).

    > **Best for:** High-dimensional, linearly separable data.\
    > **Key feature:** Works well for text classification tasks.
*   Logistic Regression

    Despite its name, this model is used for **classification**, not regression. It estimates the probability of a class using a mathematical function (logistic/sigmoid), making it useful for binary or multi-class tasks.

    > **Best for:** Binary classification problems.\
    > **Key advantage:** Outputs class probabilities.
*   MLP Classifier (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

    A type of **neural network** model that learns non-linear relationships using multiple layers of artificial neurons. It’s capable of modeling complex patterns.

    > **Best for:** Non-linear and complex classification tasks.\
    > **Note:** Requires more computation and tuning.
*   Random Forest

    An **ensemble model** that builds multiple decision trees and combines their results for more accurate and robust predictions.

    > **Best for:** Versatile, general-purpose classification.\
    > **Key advantage:** Handles both numerical and categorical features well.
*   Ridge Classifier

    A linear model similar to logistic regression, but uses **regularization** (penalty on large weights) to prevent overfitting. It’s useful when the number of features is high.

    > **Best for:** High-dimensional data with possible overfitting issues.\
    > **Key term:** L2 regularization.
*   SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)

    A fast and scalable linear classifier that uses a **step-by-step learning process** to update the model. It is especially useful for large-scale datasets.

    > **Best for:** Large datasets and real-time updates.\
    > **Note:** Requires careful tuning of learning rate and iterations.
*   SVC (Support Vector Classifier)

    A general form of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that finds the optimal boundary between classes and can model **non-linear relationships** using kernel tricks.

    > **Best for:** Complex but small-to-medium-sized datasets.\
    > **Key feature:** Can use non-linear boundaries via kernels.
