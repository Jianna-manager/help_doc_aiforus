# Exercise Platform

## Featuring questions

After going through the **Educational Resources**, you may want to test and reinforce your understanding—that’s where the **Exercise Platform** comes in.

Our tool currently includes a variety of built-in questions designed to help you assess your knowledge. Once you’ve completed and submitted all the questions, you’ll receive an overall score along with explanations for any incorrect answers.

In future updates, we plan to expand the platform with even more diverse and interactive practice opportunities.

## Hands-on Datasets Practice

We provide public datasets under the **Analysis** module, allowing you to apply the knowledge gained from the **Educational Resources** in a hands-on way.

When you select a public dataset, you'll be taken to an Excel-like interface where you can experiment with various methods across different steps to generate analysis results.
