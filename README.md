# Introduction

As AI continues to revolutionize numerous industries and become an integral part of daily life, there is an increasing demand for accessible AI tools and educational resources.&#x20;

AIforUs aims to bridge this gap by creating a user-friendly AI platform accessible to **anyone with a middle school education**. Our mission is to democratize AI by providing a tool requiring **no prior machine learning or coding knowledge**. Designed for ease of use, AIforUs leverages a mouse-driven, graphical user interface, ensuring that anyone familiar with Excel can harness the power of AI **without technical barriers**.

AIforUs is available in two versions:&#x20;

1. a local version that functions without internet access.
2. an online version with a robust backend for enhanced capabilities.&#x20;

This dual approach accommodates users across diverse environments and needs, from individuals without a college education and those in non-technical fields to professionals who require reliable tools for preliminary analyses before advancing to more complex workflows.&#x20;

By prioritizing simplicity and efficiency, we aim to empower individuals to learn, explore, and apply AI across various domains.
